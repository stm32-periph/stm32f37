@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use the WakeUp from STOP feature of I2C device using 
the CPAL library. This example requires two boards, one configured in master mode
and another one configured in slave mode.

The I2C of the slave board is configured as slave device which enters in STOP mode
after activating The WakeUp from stop ability. 

The master board is used to WakeUp the slave board from STOP. By pushing the key Button
of the master board, the I2C device initialize a communication by sending a Start condition
followed by the address of slave device. 

The slave device is woken Up from STOP if it recognizes its own address. 
The received data is checked and the result is displayed on LCD. 

This procedure is repeated infinitely.

The main.h file contains defines(I2C_MASTER, I2C_SLAVE) that select the type of 
the board(master or slave).

Note: Before entering STOP The I2C clock source must be set to HSI.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F37x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32373C-EVAL (STM32F37x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32373C-EVAL Set-up
    - Two boards must be used to run this example. The type of the board is selected
      by comments or uncomments defines (I2C_MASTER, I2C_SLAVE) located in main.h file.
    - These two boards should be connected as follow after loading the example:
     - Connect I2C2 SCL pin (PA9) to I2C2 SCL pin (PA9)
     - Connect I2C2 SDA pin (PA10) to I2C2 SDA pin (PA10)
     - Connect Gnd pins of two boards.
    - Make sure that JP4 and JP5 jumpers are fitted in position 2-3.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F37x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Add the following files the project source list
     - Libraries/STM32F37x_I2C_CPAL_Driver/src/stm32f37x_i2c_cpal.c
     - Libraries/STM32F37x_I2C_CPAL_Driver/src/stm32f37x_i2c_cpal_hal.c
     - Project/STM32F37x_StdPeriph_Templates/stm32f37x_i2c_cpal_usercallback.c  
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
