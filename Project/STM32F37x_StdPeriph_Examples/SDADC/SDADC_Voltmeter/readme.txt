@par Example Description 

This example aims to show how to use the 16-bit resolution Sigma-Delta
Analog-to-Digital converter to perform precise voltage measurement when input 
voltage is ranges between 0V and VREF/gain.

 - The SDADC is configured in Single Ended Zero Reference mode: the input range
   is 0V to VREF/gain.
   In this example, the gain is set to 1 so all the range [0, VREF] is used.
 - The SDADC is configured in injected continuous mode. At each end of conversion
   an interrupt occurs and the SDADC data register is read in SDADC ISR.
 - In Single Ended Zero Reference mode, the input voltage is computed using the
   following formula: (InjectedConvData + 32768) * SDADCVREF / 65535
   With:
      - SDADCVREF is the SDADC reference voltage which is set to 3.3V on the 
      STM32373C-EVAL evaluation board.
      - InjectedConvData is the digital value read from SDADC data register
 - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to SDADC1 channel 5P mapped on pin PB1.
   The potentiometer RV3 available on STM32373C-EVAL can be used. 
   The measured voltage on PB1 is displayed on the LCD mounted on the STM32373C-EVAL
   evaluation board.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F37x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32373C-EVAL (STM32F37x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32373C-EVAL Set-up
    - Make sure that jumper JP16 and JP17 are fitted.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F37x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
