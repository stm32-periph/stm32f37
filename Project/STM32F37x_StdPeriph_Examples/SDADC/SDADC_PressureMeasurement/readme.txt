@par Example Description 

This example aims to show how to use the 16-bit resolution Sigma-Delta
Analog-to-Digital converter to perform differential pressure measurement using
the MPX2102A sensor mounted on the STM32373C-EVAL evaluation board.

 - The SDADC channel 8 is configured in differential mode.
   The external reference VREF (set to 3.3V on STM32373C-EVAL) is used as reference for SDADC.
   The conversion is triggered by TIM19 with interrupt enabled on end of injected conversion.
   A MPX2102A sensor is connected to SDADC1 channel 8P (PE8) and channel 8N (PE9).
   The MPX2102 sensitivity when powered by 3.3V is 3.3V * 40mV / 10V = 13.2mV/1000mB
                                                                     = 13.2 microV/mB
   To increase the sensitivity an external 45.1 gain using the operation amplifier
   TVS632 mounted on STM32373C-EVAL is used. The same opeartion amplifier is
   used to shift up the input voltage by 3.3V/10.0f = 0.33V
   Refer to STM32373C-EVAL user manual for more details about how the MPX2102 is
   connected to PE8 and PE9

 - The measured pressure is displayed on the LCD mounted on STM32373C-EVAL.
   In order to get an accurate measurement of pressure a calibration phase 
   should be added using a known pressure value.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F37x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32373C-EVAL (STM32F37x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32373C-EVAL Set-up
    - Make sure that jumper JP16 and JP17 are fitted.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F37x_StdPeriph_Templates
