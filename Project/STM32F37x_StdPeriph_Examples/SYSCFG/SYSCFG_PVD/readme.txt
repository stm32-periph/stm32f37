@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the programmable voltage detector.

In this example:
  - TIM15 is configured to generate a PWM signal on pin PA.02.
  - PVD threshold is configured to 2.68V.
   
While Vdd is higher than the PVD threshold (~2.68 V), PWM signal is displayed on PA.02.
While Vdd is lower than the PVD threshold (~2.58 V), PA2 is in low level.

@note   Refer to the electrical characteristics of your device datasheet for more
        details about the voltage threshold corresponding to each PVD detection level.

@note The "system_stm32f37x.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F37x_Clock_Configuration_V1.1.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN4132 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
         
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F37x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32373C-EVAL (STM32F37x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32373C-EVAL Set-up
    - Use RV2 Potentiometer to adjust Vdd.
    - Make sure That jumper JP12 in position(VDD_ADJ).
    - Connect an oscilloscope to PA.02 pin to display waveform.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F37x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
