@par Example Description 

This example provides a basic example of how to use the SPI firmware library
and an associate SPI SDcard driver to communicate with an SDcard available on the 
eval board.
The first step consist in filling the SPI Tx buffer. Then this last one is written 
on the micro sd cards. A comparison between the Buffer transmitted (Tx_Buffer )and 
the received one (Rx_Buffer) is done and LED1 is turned on in caseof success otherwise 
LED2 is turned on.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F37x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32373C-EVAL (STM32F37x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32373C-EVAL Set-up
    - MicroSD card is already available on this board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F37x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Add the following file the project source list
     - Utilities/STM32_EVAL/STM32373C_EVAL/stm32373c_eval_spi_sd.c
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
