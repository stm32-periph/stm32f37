@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use the TIM peripheral to measure the frequency and 
duty cycle of an external signal.

The TIMxCLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock(Hz), the Prescaler is 0 so the 
counter clock is SystemCoreClock(Hz).
SystemCoreClock is set to 72 MHz fro STM32F37x Devices.

TIM2 is configured in PWM Input Mode: the external signal is connected to 
TIM2 Channel2 used as input pin.
To measure the frequency and the duty cycle we use the TIM2 CC2 interrupt request,
so In the TIM2_IRQHandler routine, the frequency and the duty cycle of the external 
signal are computed. 
The "Frequency" variable contains the external signal frequency:
TIM2 counter clock = SystemCoreClock,
Frequency = TIM2 counter clock / TIM2_CCR2 in Hz, 
The "DutyCycle" variable contains the external signal duty cycle:
DutyCycle = (TIM2_CCR1*100)/(TIM2_CCR2) in %.

The minimum frequency value to measure is 1098 Hz (TIM2 counter clock / CCR MAX).

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F37x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32373C-EVAL (STM32F37x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32373C-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect the external signal to measure to the TIM2 CH2 pin (PA.01).

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F37x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
