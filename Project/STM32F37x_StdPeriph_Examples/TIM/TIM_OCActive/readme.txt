@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM peripheral to generate four different 
signals with four different delays.

The TIM3CLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock (Hz), and the objective is
to get TIM3 counter clock at 10 KHz so the Prescaler is computed as following:
   - Prescaler = (TIM3CLK / TIM3 counter clock) - 1
   
SystemCoreClock is set to 72 MHz for stm32f37x Devices.

The TIM3 CCR1 register value is equal to 1000:
TIM3_CH1 delay = CCR1_Val/TIM3 counter clock  = 100 ms
so the TIM3 Channel 1 generates a signal with a delay equal to 100 ms.

The TIM3 CCR2 register value is equal to 50:
TIM3_CH2 delay = CCR2_Val/TIM3 counter clock = 50 ms
so the TIM3 Channel 2 generates a signal with a delay equal to 50 ms.

The TIM3 CCR3 register value is equal to 25:
TIM3_CH3 delay = CCR3_Val/TIM3 counter clock = 25 ms
so the TIM3 Channel 3 generates a signal with a delay equal to 25 ms.

The TIM3 CCR4 register value is equal to 12.5:
TIM3_CH4 delay = CCR4_Val/TIM3 counter clock = 12.5 ms
so the TIM3 Channel 4 generates a signal with a delay equal to 12.5 ms.

The delay correspond to the time difference between PC.00 and  TIM3_CHx signal
rising edges.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on stm32f37x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32373C-EVAL (stm32f37x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32373C-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different 
      waveforms:
       - Use LED1 connected to PC.00
       - PA.06 (TIM3_CH1)
       - PA.07 (TIM3_CH2)
       - PB.00 (TIM3_CH3)
       - PB.07 (TIM3_CH4)

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\stm32f37x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

@note
 - stm32F37x devices are STM32F373x microcontrollers where the Flash memory 
   density ranges between 128 and 256 Kbytes.
