@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM peripheral to interface with a encoder sensor.
The TIM3 is configured in encoder mode1: Counter counts up/down on TI2 rising edge 
depending on TI1 level 

The TIM3 Autoreload value is set to 399, so the encoder round is 400 TIM counter clock. 
An update interrupt is generated each time the TIM counter reach the Autoreload value, 
in this example 400 TIM counter clock.

      provided with the AN4132 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
         
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on stm32f37x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32373C-EVAL (stm32f37x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\stm32f37x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

@note
 - stm32f37x devices are STM32F37x microcontrollers where the Flash memory 
   density ranges between 128 and 256 Kbytes.
