@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use the TIM peripheral to measure the frequency of an 
external signal.

The TIMxCLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock (Hz), the Prescaler is 0 so the 
TIM2 counter clock is SystemCoreClock (Hz).

SystemCoreClock is set to 72 MHz.

TIM2 is configured in Input Capture Mode: the external signal is connected to 
TIM2 Channel2 used as input pin.
To measure the frequency we use the TIM2 CC2 interrupt request, so In the 
TIM2_IRQHandler routine, the frequency of the external signal is computed. 
The "TIM2Freq" variable contains the external signal frequency:
TIM2Freq = TIM1 counter clock / Capture in Hz, where the Capture is the difference 
between two consecutive TIM2 captures. 

The minimum frequency value to measure is 1Hz.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F37x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32373C-EVAL (STM32F37x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32373C-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect the external signal to measure to the TIM2 CH2 pin (PA.01).

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F37x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
