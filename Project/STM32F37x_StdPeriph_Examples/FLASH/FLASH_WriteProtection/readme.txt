@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to enable and disable the write protection
for the STM32F37x FLASH:

- Enable Write protection: 
   To enable the Write Protection, uncomment the line "#define WRITE_PROTECTION_ENABLE"
   in main.c file.  
   To protect a set of pages, the user has to call the function FLASH_EnableWriteProtection.
   The parameter of this function will define the number of pages to be protected.
   To load the new option byte values, a system Reset is necessary, for this, the
   function FLASH_OB_Launch() is used.
 
- Disable Write protection:
   To disable the Write Protection, uncomment the line "#define WRITE_PROTECTION_DISABLE"
   in main.c file.
   To disable the write protection of the STM32F37x Flash, an erase of the Option 
   Bytes is necessary. This operation is done by the function FLASH_EraseOptionBytes.
   To load the new option byte values, a system Reset is necessary, for this, the
   function FLASH_OB_Launch() is used.

If the desired pages are not write protected, an erase and a write operation are
performed.

@note The "system_stm32f37x.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F37x_Clock_Configuration_V1.1.0.xls"

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F37x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32373C-EVAL (STM32F37x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  
@par How to use it ?
