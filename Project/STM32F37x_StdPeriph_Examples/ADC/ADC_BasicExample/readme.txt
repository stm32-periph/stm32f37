@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use the ADC1 to convert continuously voltage applied
to a given analog input channel.
Detailed steps of ADC configuration are provided starting from GPIO configuration
to the analog channel configuration without forgetting the ADC calibration procedure.  
In this example the ADC1 Channel9(PB1) is used as directly connected to the potentiometer
(RV3) available on the STM32373C-EVAL evaluation board.

The ADC clock is set to system clock div 4 = 56 MHz / 4 = 14 MHz.

The converted voltage is displayed on the onboard LCD.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F37x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32373C-EVAL (STM32F37x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32373C-EVAL Set-up    
    - RV3 Potentiometer connected to PB.01 pin.
    - Make sure that the jumper JP16 is fitted.
    - Make sure that the jumper JP12 and JP13 are fitted in 3V3 position.
    
@par How to use it ?
