@par Example Description 

This example aims to show how to use the CRC peripheral in order to compute
32-bit CRC checksum of a message.
The CRC peripheral is configured to use the 32-bit CRC polynomial
X32 + X26 + X23 + X22 + X16 + X12 + X11 + X10 +X8 + X7 + X5 + X4 + X2+ X +1 
with the initialization value set to 0.
The message is declared as an array and labeled "CRCBuffer".
Once the CRC value is computed, it is compared to the expected one. In case of 
match the green led LD1 is turned on. Otherwise the led LD3 is turned on.
