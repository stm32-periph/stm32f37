@par Example Description 

This example aims to show how to use the CRC peripheral in order to compute
8-bit CRC checksum of a message.
The CRC peripheral is configured to use the 8-bit CRC polynomial x8 + x7 + x6 + x4 + x2 + 1 
with the initialization value set to 0.
The message is declared as an array and labeled "CRCBuffer".
The expected CRC value is already computed using an on line CRC tool.
Once the CRC value is computed, the computed CRC value is compared to the expected
one. In case of match the green led LD1 is turned on. Otherwise the led LD3 is turned on.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F37x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32373C-EVAL (STM32F37x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F37x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
