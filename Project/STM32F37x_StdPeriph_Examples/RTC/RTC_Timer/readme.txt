@par Example Description 

  This example provides a short description of how to use the RTC peripheral’s with 
  Alarm sub seconds feature to simulate a timer with refresh time equal to 250 ms
  (1 second/ 8) * 2).
  The RTC is configured to generate sub seconds interrupt each 125ms (will have
  8 interrupt per second).
  
  For this example an interactive human interface is developed using
  LCD and Push Buttons to allow user to use Timer with a real "sand timer"
  display.

  At startup, the sand timer is equal to 1 minute (60 Seconds) and by pressing
  the RIGHT button the bottom bulb start to be filled each 2 successive
  interrupts (after each 250ms).
  After 480 interrupts (60 * 8) the bottom bulb will be full.

  User can manipulate the chronometer features using the Joystick LEFT, RIGHT, UP and DOWN buttons:
    - press Joystick RIGHT button to Start the timer.
    - press again Joystick RIGHT button to stop the timer.
    - press Joystick LEFT button to Restart the timer.
    - press Joystick  UP/DOWN button to adjust the timer.

@note The "system_stm32f37x.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F37x_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls"

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F37x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32373C-EVAL (STM32F37x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32373C-EVAL Set-up
    - Use Joystick UP button connected to pin PF10
    - Use Joystick DOWN button connected to pin PF2
    - Use Joystick RIGHT button connected to pin PF9
    - Use Joystick LEFT button connected to pin PF4

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F37x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
