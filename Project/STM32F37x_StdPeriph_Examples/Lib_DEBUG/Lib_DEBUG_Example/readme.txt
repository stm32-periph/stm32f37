@par Example  Description 

This example demonstrates how to declare a dynamic peripherals pointers used for
Debug mode.  

To use Debug mode you have to add the stm32f37x_ip_dbg.c file to your application.
This creates a pointer to the peripheral structure in SRAM. Debugging consequently
becomes easier and all register settings can be obtained by dumping a peripheral 
variable.

When the "USE_FULL_ASSERT" label is uncommented (in stm32f37x_conf.h file),
the assert_param macro is expanded and run-time checking is enabled in the firmware
library code. The run-time checking allows checking that all the library functions
input value lies within the parameter allowed values.

The associated program simulates wrong parameter passed to library function and the
source of the error is printed on Hyperterminal (through USART).

@note
The Debug mode increases the code size and reduces the code performance. For this
reason, it is recommended to use it only when debugging the application and to
remove it from the final application code.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F37x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32373C-EVAL (STM32F37x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32373C-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector CN12
        and PC serial port.
    - Make sure that JP6 is in position 2<->3         

  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - flow control: None 


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F37x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Add the "stm32f37x_ip_dbg.c" file to the project source list 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
