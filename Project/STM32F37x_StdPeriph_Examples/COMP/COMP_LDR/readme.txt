@par Example Description 

The STM32F37x microcontroller has an embedded comparator which can be used
in combination with DAC peripheral for more application like light intensity 
measurement(using the LDR sensor).

In this example when the luminosity changes the progress bar displayed on the color
LCD changes according to light intensity level detected on comparator.
