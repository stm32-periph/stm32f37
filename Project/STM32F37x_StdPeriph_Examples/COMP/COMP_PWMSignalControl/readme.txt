@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure COMP1 peripheral to hold on safe state
(low level) TIM15 channels as soon as COMP1 output is set at high level.

  - COMP1 is configured as follow:
     - Inverting input is internally connected to VREFINT = 1.22V
     - Non Inverting input is connected to PA1
     - Output is internally connected to TIM15 BKIN (Break Input)

  - TIM15CLK is set to 72 MHz, the TIM15 Prescaler is equal to 0 so the TIM15 counter
    clock used is 72 MHz.
    TIM15 frequency is defined as follow:
    TIM15 channels frequency = TIM15 counter clock / (Period + 1) 
                            = 72000000 /(100 + 1) 
                            = 713 KHz.

  - External voltage should be connected to PA.01 (RV3 potentiometer can be used).

  - Connect an oscilloscope to TIM15 channel PA.02 to display waveform. 

  - While PA.01 is lower than VREFINT (1.22V), PWM signal is displayed on PA.02.
    While PA.01 is higher than VREFINT, PA.02 is in low level.

      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F37x_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN4132 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
         
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F37x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32373C-EVAL (STM32F37x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32373C-EVAL Set-up
    - RV3 Potentiometer connected to PB.01 pin.
    - Connect PA.01 to PB.01 pin using a wire.
    - Connect an oscilloscope to PA.02 pin to display waveform.
    - Make sure that jumper JP16 is fitted.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F37x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
